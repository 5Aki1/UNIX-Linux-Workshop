# Exercise 3

In the last exercise, we used built-in commands to sort the bedfile. 

For this exercise, I would like you to use the tool [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to do the same thing with 02-time_for_bed/start.bed.

- How much time does it take?

- Run make_bed.sh and save it as large_bed.bed.

- Compare the time it takes between sort and bedtools sort.
