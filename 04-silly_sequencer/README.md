# Exercise 4

To start the exercise, run sequencer.sh.

The sequencer generates 1000 random 8-mers.

The expected nucleotides are A,T,C,G. However, occasionally the sequencer makes a mistake and introduces an N.

The goal of this exercise is to figure out how many mistakes were made in the output (# of lines) and to remove those lines.
